5. WHEN handling logout THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication data and redirect appropriately
6. WHEN implementing route protection THEN the system SHALL maintain existing AuthGuard functionality
7. WHEN handling API calls THEN the system SHALL include authentication headers in all requests
8. WHEN managing errors THEN the system SHALL handle authentication errors gracefully

### Requirement 6: Data Migration Strategy
